Set the working directory to /code.
Set environment variables used by the flask command.
Install gcc and other dependencies
Copy requirements.txt and install the Python dependencies.
Add metadata to the image to describe that the container is listening on port 5000
Copy the current directory . in the project to the workdir . in the image.
Set the default command for the container to flask run --debug.
